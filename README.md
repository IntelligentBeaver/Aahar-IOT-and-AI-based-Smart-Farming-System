# Smart Irrigation and Crops Monitoring System  

## Project Overview  
The Smart Irrigation and Crops Monitoring System is an innovative IoT-based solution designed to empower farmers by automating farm monitoring, irrigation, and data management. This system not only tracks environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture but also enables efficient irrigation control, plant health diagnosis, and agricultural tracking. The system is designed to help farmers optimize water usage, improve crop yield, and manage farming expenses effectively.

## Features  

### 1. **Smart Irrigation**  
Automate, schedule, or manually control motor pumps using IoT for efficient water management, ensuring water is used only when necessary and at optimal times.

### 2. **Real-Time Monitoring**  
Monitor soil fertility, moisture, and weather data via a Flutter app. This enables farmers to keep track of key factors that influence crop health and growth.

### 3. **Precision Land Leveling**  
Use laser-guided systems to efficiently prepare the land for planting, ensuring uniformity and improved productivity.

### 4. **Plant Health Diagnosis**  
Utilize advanced technology to detect plant diseases or conditions by analyzing the leaves, enabling timely intervention and treatment.

### 5. **News and Updates**  
Receive timely national and international agricultural news and updates directly within the app to stay informed about the latest trends and technologies in agriculture.

### 6. **Agricultural Tracking**  
Monitor and store data on farming expenses, fertilizers, crops, and other agricultural activities, providing clarity on investments and helping farmers make informed decisions.
